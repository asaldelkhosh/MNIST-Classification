# Numbers Recognition

A neural network for recognizing numbers.

## What is this project about?
This is a project about using non-negative matrix factorization for weight initialization in autoencoders.

Autoencoders are a specific form of neural networks build by two parts. First part is used to encode the input data to a space with lower dimension and the second part decodes the abstracted data to reconstruct the input.

The networks is trained in a way that the reocnstructed data is very similar to the original input. This way we can make sure that we are transferring enough information to a small encoded space so that we are enable to reconstruct the entire image from it.
